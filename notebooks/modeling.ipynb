    "## Introdução\n",
    "Este notebook contém a parte de modelagem da análise de crédito (Enviar para o analista). Os modelos utilizados aqui são o *lightgbm* e *xgboost*. Foi feita uma otimização de hiperparametros (número de estimadores) utilizando o optuna. Foram testadas duas formas de calibração de probabilidade para o modelo, sigmoid e isotônica. O dataset foi dividido em treino e *out-of-sample* (validação).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contexto do problema\n",
    "Criar um modelo de machine learning que irá responder, com uma certa probabilidade, quais as chances de uma pessoa com a coluna **pre_approved** igual a 1 tem de ser enviado para um analista (**sent_to_analysis**).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dados\n",
    "- 35 mil linhas\n",
    "- 1 coluna para filtro **pre_approved**\n",
    "- 1 coluna com rótulo **sent_to_analysis**\n",
    "- 1 coluna como identificador\n",
    "- Possíveis 29 colunas como características\n",
    "- 24 colunas categóricas (incluindo as boleanas)\n",
    "- 7 colunas numéricas \n",
    "\n",
    "## Metodologia\n",
    "\n",
    "- Um pre-processamento foi feito para remover as colunas que não foram utilizadas para treinamento e validação do modelo\n",
    "    - Coluna de identificação\n",
    "    - Colunas contendo vieses: **age, city, gender, education_level, zip_code, marital_status**\n",
    "    - Colunas com grande quantidade de nulos: **loan_term**\n",
    "    - Colunas que não possuem utilidade no momento: **informed_purpose, pre_approved**\n",
    "- Dois modelos foram testados: *xgboost* e *lightgbm*\n",
    "- A métrica principal de avaliação será PR-AUC, já que os casos positivos, enviar para o analista (**sent_to_analysis**), é o ponto chave do problema.\n",
    "- Foi feita uma otimização de hiperparâmetros dos modelos utilizando um cross-validation com 90% dos dados usando o algoritmo Optuna. O restante dos dados (dataset *out-of-sample*) foi utilizado para calcular as métricas de desempenho real do modelo (validação). \n",
    "- Ao final os dois modelos foram testados no dataset de validação (1500 linhas) para calcular seu desempenho real.\n",
    "- Calculo de matriz de confusão\n",
    "- Foi feito uma calibração da saída do modelo utilizando isotonic calibration e sigmoid calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resultados \n",
    "\n",
    "O modelo que desempenhou melhor foi o lightgbm com PR-AUC de 0.42 contra 0.37 (*xgboost*) no dataset de validação. Nenhuma das calibrações mostraram resultados satisfatorios quanto a saída do modelo. "
